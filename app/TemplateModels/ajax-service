   * Define service's logic here to make a response and send it to client.
   *
   * To build an api-like service, you can use wp_send_json_success($response) and
   * wp_send_json_error($response) if you need to send different data according to
   * your logic's success or error cases; use wp_send_json($response) otherwise.
   *
   * For a non-json response, you can simply echo the generated data. In this case,
   * don't forget to call wp_die() at the end of the function to stop execution.
   *
