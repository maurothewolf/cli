# Wordrobe theme example

All files and folders of this example have been automatically generated by *Wordrobe*. More specifically, with the __add:theme__ command the default theme boilerplate has been created and with the __add:post-type__ command the *Event* custom post type has been added in order to demonstrate the implementation of the *[entity/repository/dto framework](../doc/FRAMEWORK.md)*. The only manual customizations can be found in [core/Entity/Event.php](core/Entity/Event.php) and [core/DTO/EventDTO.php](core/DTO/EventDTO.php) files.

N.B.: the example assumes *[ACF](https://www.advancedcustomfields.com)* usage.
